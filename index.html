      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a frontend web developer based in Nigeria, focused on crafting practical, real-world solutions with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        I believe in writing code that not only works, but is also readable, scalable, and accessible.
      </p>
      <p>
        My current focus is on deepening my JavaScript skills by building interactive projects that mirror real application behavior—handling user input, managing UI state, and working with the DOM in meaningful ways.
        I host my projects publicly on GitHub as a way to share my learning process and showcase what I can do.
